Made the website yesterday, and committed it to GitHub. Plan for today is to get started on some game development in Godot and learn how to webexport the games and host them in there

Have been keeping up the website and developing some Plinko features. I have also been recording some gameplay to make youtube videos. I shifted from trying to find games to make a video about to simply recording the games i enjoyed playing, feels more natural and less like work when i have to play a new game.
